				<h3>Prospective Students</h3>

				<p>A note to prospective students at any level: I <strong>do not</strong> respond to mass mailings (unless you have made an outstanding AI software that convinces me yours is not a mass email). If you will not take the time to read a couple of pages in my website and the abstract of a couple of my papers to discover if I am a good fit for your areas of interest in research, then I will not spend more than the 2 seconds it takes to delete your email (and mark you as a spammer). Note that this does not mean I will not advise work outside my specific areas of interest within AI---should you want me to advise you, explaining to me why you are excited about a different area is an excellent start.
				Finally, <strong>I do not take part-time PhD students</strong>. I will take part-time MSc students, but not PhDs because I reckon the commitment and amount of free time required to think of innovative research ideas is non-trivial.</p>

				<h3>Graduate Students</h3>

				<p>Before you start doing any kind of research, you <strong>need</strong> to be able to write about it in decent English. Understandably, for most of my students, english is not the first language, so there are two obstacles to conveying research ideas: mastering the language, and writing about research in the best style.
				For the first problem, there is not much I can do. However, for the second one, there is a slew of resources available on the web, which I have condensed in a site covering <a href="writing.shtml">writing style</a>.
				</p>

				<p>And also check conference impact ratings:</p>

				<p>Brazilian impact rating for Robotics and AI conferences from <a href="http://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/eventos/qualis">UFMG</a></br>
				Google Scholar impact rating for AI venues: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence">Google Scholar</a></p>

				<p><strong>Checkpoints (MSc)</strong></p>

				<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Study and Research Project (Projeto de Estudo e Pesquisa)</p>

				<p> As the name implies, this checkpoint consists of a report that outlines what you will be doing in your second year of MSc. This deliverable is a small survey of what you have studied in your first year, followed by a project describing the activities and expected timeline of their conclusion in the subsequent year, key elements in this project are:</p>

				<ul class="fa-ul marginbot-50">
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> one background section with an extensive literature review and survey of the area of the proposed MSc dissertation </li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> one clear <em>research question</em> that your work aims to solve (note that MSc research questions need not be entirely original) that is substantiated by the survey above</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> a general objective (i.e. how do you aim to address the question posed above) followed by specific objectives (activities, deliverables you will do throughout the second year)</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> a plan of activities that will ensure the objectives above will be done.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Progress Report (Seminário de Andamento)</p>

				<p>This <em>looks</em> like a regular paper, and most of its content should look like one. However, you should be careful about the actual <em>objective</em> of this check point, which is to assess how your MSc/PhD is going in relation to your Study and Research Project.<br/>
				Key elements in this report include: </p>

				<ul class="fa-ul marginbot-50">
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> an introduction reinforcing the objectives stated in the research project (see above)</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> content sections describing the progress made so far and the results obtained;</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> a section describing the progress made on each activity: explain what was done, what were the results, and when things are not done, explain what is missing and which activities are on time; and</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> a conclusion summarising the contributions so far and describing, in general terms the prospects of finishing the work on time.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Undergraduate Students</h3>
				<p> If you are currently under my advice as a scientific apprentice scholar, here are the key events you need to mindful of (and aware of the deadlines):
				<ul class="researchguides marginbot-50">
					<li><a href="http://www.pucrs.br/seminarioic/">Seminário Interno de Avaliação da Iniciação Científica</a> -- your first, optional, checkpoint. If the work is going really well and you have results worth talking about to a greater audience, go ahead and register for this! (but talk to me first)</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.pucrs.br/salao/">Salão de Iniciação Científica</a> -- your <strong>primary</strong> checkpoint and the commitment you made when you signed up for the apprenticeship. Any IC student of my needs to register for this and show what has been achieved.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>


				<p><strong>Final year projects</strong></p>
				<p> Check out forms and guidance at their official website <a href="http://www.inf.pucrs.br/alunos/tc_pratica/tccc/index.htm">Trabalho de Conclusão Ciência da Computação</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~coordtc/NormasTC1.htm">guidance for the writeup of the dissertation</a>. 
				Here is a list of potential final year projects:
				</p>
				<ul class="researchguides marginbot-50">
					<li><strong>Stochastic Normative Reasoning:</strong> Implement a simulator for stochastic normative reasoning</li>
					<li><strong>Fancy UI for Jason:</strong> Integrate some fancy UI engine into an agent programming platform, for example, the <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/">Mason framework</a></li>
					<li><strong>Normative Gold Miners:</strong> Implement and evaluate a variation of the gold miners simulator with a parameterisable norm monitor so that certain norms can be specified as well as a customisable norm detection mechanism</li>
					<li><strong>Integrating Jason with a Visualisation Tool:</strong> Assuming <a href="http://mavs.utdallas.edu/projects/divas">DIVAs</a> is open in some way (it does not look like it at this point), integrate the Jason interpreter in it to do norm based behaviour simulation.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Checkpoints (Computer Science)</strong></p>

				<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Final Year Project Proposal (Proposta de TC1)</p>
				<p>This is basically a plan for what you aim to study in your final year project. What you need to have in this document:</p>
				<ul class="fa-ul marginbot-50">
				  	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> Some reviewers complain if you do not write an abstract, so do it just to be on the safeside;</li>
				 	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> An introduction motivating the work (see my <a href="research.shtml">research page</a>)</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> A small literature review to show the reviewer you have an idea of what you want to study</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i> A work/study schedule stating what you will do during the semester (a monthly granularity is good enough) </li>
				</ul>
