  abstract = {Research on practical models of autonomous agents has largely focused
	on a \emph{procedural} view of goal achievement. This allows for
	efficient implementations, but prevents an agent from reasoning about
	alternative courses of action for the achievement of its design objectives.
	In this paper we show how a procedural agent model can be modified
	to allow an agent to compose existing plans into new ones at runtime
	to achieve desired world states. This new agent model can be used
	to implement a declarative goals interpreter, since it allows designers
	to specify \emph{only} the desired world states in addition to an
	agent's basic capabilities, enhancing the agent's ability to deal
	with failures. Moreover our approach allows the new plans to be included
	in the plan library, effectively enabling the agent to improve its
	runtime performance over time.},
