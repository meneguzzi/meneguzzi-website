  abstract = {A number of mechanisms for providing fault tolerance in distributed
	systems have been proposed for the traditional paradigms of system
	development. As Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) becomes a more attractive
	model for distributed system construction, new possibilities of designing
	more flexible dependable systems are foreseen. Therefore, fault-tolerant
	mechanisms should be defined so that dependable multi-agent systems
	might be developed. In this paper we describe a way of implementing
	a fault-tolerant multi-agent system, which is inspired in some of
	the mechanisms proposed for distributed systems.},
