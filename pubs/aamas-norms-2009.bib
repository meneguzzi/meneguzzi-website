  abstract = {While there has been much work on developing frameworks and models
	of norms and normative systems, consideration of the impact of norms
	on the practical reasoning of agents has attracted less attention.
	The problem is that traditional agent architectures and their associated
	languages provide no mechanism to adapt an agent at runtime to norms
	constraining their behaviour. This is important because if BDI-type
	agents are to operate in open environments, they need to adapt to
	changes in the norms that regulate such environments. In response,
	in this paper we provide a technique to extend BDI agent languages,
	by enabling them to enact behaviour modification at runtime in response
	to newly accepted norms. Our solution consists of creating new plans
	to comply with obligations and suppressing the execution of existing
	plans that violate prohibitions. We demonstrate the viability of
	our approach through an implementation of our solution in the AgentSpeak(L)
	language.},
