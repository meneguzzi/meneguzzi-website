  abstract = {In this paper, we present the modelling of a domain of argumentation-based negotiation with scarce resources so that Hierarchical Task Network planning can be used for finding appropriate strategies for the negotiating agents. In our modelling, the agents justify their positions on interactions throughout the course of a negotiation episode, and such justifications are taken into account in future interactions. This approach allows the agents to plan the outcome of a negotiation and use this information in their favour. Our method, further, selects the best plan among those found by the HTN planner, based on the plan costs. This allows the agents to choose the best reachable plan in order to reach the desired outcome.},
