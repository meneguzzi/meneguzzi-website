abstract = {An assistant refers to a (human or software) agent that helps a user accomplish her goals, ideally with minimal instructions from the user. In this paper we describe a software assistant agent that can proactively assist human users situated in a time-constrained dynamic environment. We specifically aim at assisting the user's normative reasoning--reasoning about prohibitions and obligations. When human users are cognitively overloaded normative stipulations hinder user's ability to plan to both accomplish goals and abide by the norms. In contrast to reactive assistant agent systems (that perform certain tasks on behalf of the user in reaction to user cues), this paper presents a goal-driven approach where the agent sets its own goals, plans and executes a series of actions to accomplish the identified goals, steering users towards norm compliance. To do so, our approach uses probabilistic plan recognition to predict the user's future plan based on the user's current activities, identifying likely norm violations in the predicted user plan, and updating the assistant's goals to accommodate potential needs for resolving norm violations. This paper introduces the general framework for the goal-driven autonomous assistant agent. Our approach has been fully implemented in the context of a military peacekeeping scenario that involves norm reasoning within various coalition partners. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that manages norms in a proactive and autonomous manner.},
