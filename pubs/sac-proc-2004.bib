  abstract = {This paper aims to describe the relationship between propositional
	planning systems and the process of means-end reasoning used by BDI
	agents. To show such relationship, we define a mapping from BDI mental
	states to propositional planning problems and from propositional
	plans back to mental states. In order to test the viability of such
	mapping, we have implemented it in an extension of a BDI agent model
	through the use of Graphplan as the propositional planning algorithm.
	The implementation was applied to model a case study of an agent
	controlled production cell.},
