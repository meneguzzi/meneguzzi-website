  abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming more and more powerful and even able to
	connect to wireless networks. Therefore, if they have network access
	they can also access services available in the Internet or in its
	local wireless network. As these devices are becoming popular and
	useful for domestic and corporate users, sets of services were and
	can be created to help these users in their daily tasks. This paper
	introduces some concepts about web services and the proposed technologies
	for their implementation. The ongoing research deals with the creation
	of web services to offer printing services on wireless networks.
	The research is supported by the cooperation project between the
	Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul and Hewlett-Packard
	Company.},
