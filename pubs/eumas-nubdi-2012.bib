  abstract = {Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to
	achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or
	unexpected properties if left unconstrained. Using deontic concepts
	of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe, what must,
	may and should not be done, norms have been widely proposed as a
	means of defining and enforcing societal constraints. Recent efforts
	to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that limit plan choices
	suffer from interfering with an agentâ€™s reasoning process, and thus
	limit autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In response,
	in this paper we describe an extension of the BDI architecture which
	enables normative reasoning, providing agents with a means to choose
	and customise plans (and their constituent actions), so as to ensure
	compliance with norms.},
