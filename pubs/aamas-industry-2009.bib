  abstract = {In the domain of aerospace aftermarkets, which often has long supply
	chains that feed into the maintenance
	
	of aircraft, contracts are used to establish agreements between aircraft
	operators and maintenance suppliers. However, violations at the bottom
	of the supply chain (part suppliers) can easily cascade to the top
	(aircraft operators), making it difficult to determine the source
	of the violation, and seek to address it.  In this context, we have
	developed a global monitoring architecture that ensures the detection
	of norm violations and generates explanations for the origin of violations.
	In this paper, we describe the implementation and deployment of a
	global monitor in the aerospace domain of \cite{Jakob2008} and show
	how it generates explanations for violations within the maintenance
	supply chain. We show how these explanations can be used not only
	to detect violations at runtime, but also to uncover potential problems
	in contracts before their deployment, thus improving them.},
