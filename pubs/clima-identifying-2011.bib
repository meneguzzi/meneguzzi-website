  abstract = {The behaviour of deliberative agents is often guided by a plan library
	designed to achieve goals given certain environmental conditions.
	Plans in these plan libraries are designed to achieve individual
	goals, and cannot possibly account for all possible variations of
	restrictions in the societies within which these agents must operate.
	These restrictions, captured through \emph{norms}, include obligations,
	prohibitions, and permissions. Unlike traditional planning restrictions,
	norms can often be contradictory and impossible to achieve simultaneously,
	necessitating some form of compromise. In this paper we describe
	a technique for taking norms into consideration when deciding how
	to execute a plan. Our norms are constraint based, allowing for fine-grained
	control over actions. Our technique allows for reasoning about the
	interactions between norms, and resolves conflict by selecting actions
	where the cost of violating one set of norms is outweighed by the
	reward obtained in complying with another.},
