abstract={As today's users process, communicate, and share more and more information
online, there have been growing interests in developing intelligent
software agent for information gathering and management. In particular,
when the user must make critical decisions under a time-pressured situation
such an intelligent agent can anticipate the user's information needs,
prefetch information, and present it to the user in an appropriate format
at the right time. Recently, several approaches to pre-fetching have been
tried in web browsers and search engines and found to be lacking. Indeed
they have proved to be too troublesome to be useful, since they fail to
take into account constraints provided by security policies and network
bandwidth. In this paper, we discuss these key challenges in designing
unobtrusive information agents, and propose a constraint-based approach
where the agent reasons about not only the relevance of information but
also user constraints and preferences in determining when and which
information to prefetch. A set of methods is also discussed for evaluating
the performance of intelligent information agents.}
