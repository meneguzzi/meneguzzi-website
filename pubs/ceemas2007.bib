  abstract = {In agent systems, meta-level reasoning is commonly used in enforcing
	rationality in the choice of goals and actions performed by an agent,
	ensuring that an agent behaves as effectively and efficiently as
	possible. Through meta-reasoning an agent is able to explicitly consider
	goals before committing to them, and consider courses of action before
	executing plans.  In this paper, we argue that although seldom considered,
	a flexible meta-level reasoning component is a valuable addition
	to any agent architecture. We describe such a component for use in
	BDI architectures, underpinned by a model of motivation and a motivation-based
	description language, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically.},
