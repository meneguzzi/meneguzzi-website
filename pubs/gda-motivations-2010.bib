  abstract = {As we move towards a richer model of computation based on interactions
	among autonomous agents in lieu of the more traditional numeric batch
	processing model, it is necessary to devise techniques and abstractions
	for the development of such autonomous agents. The ability to generate,
	reason about, and select the means to achieve explicit goals is critical
	for autonomous agents, the so called goal-driven autonomy. Reasoning
	about goals demands a suitable abstraction for meta-level reasoning,
	so that an agent not only reasons about the actions it needs to take,
	but also about the viability of (and interaction among) such goals.
	In this paper we discuss the use of motivations as an abstraction
	of meta-reasoning for goal-driven autonomous agents. We review recent
	developments in motivated agent architectures and discuss possible
	directions for future research.},
