  abstract = {Many architectures of autonomous agent have been proposed throughout
	AI research. The most common architectures, BDI, are procedural in
	that they do no planning, seriously curtailing an agent's ability
	to cope with unforeseen events. In this paper, we explore the relationship
	between propositional planning systems and the process of means-ends
	reasoning used by BDI agents and define a mapping from BDI mental
	states to propositional planning problems and from propositional
	plans back to mental states. In order to test the viability of such
	a mapping, we have implemented it in an extension of a BDI agent
	model through the use of Graphplan as the propositional planning
	algorithm. The implemented prototype was applied to model a case
	study of an agent controlled production cell.},
