  abstract = {Distributed systems comprised of autonomous self-interested entities
	require some sort of control mechanism to ensure the predictability
	of the interactions that drive them. This is certainly true in the
	aerospace domain, where manufacturers, suppliers and operators must
	coordinate their activities to maximise safety and profit, for example.
	To address this need, the notion of norms has been proposed which,
	when incorporated into formal electronic documents, allow for the
	specification and deployment of contract-driven systems. In this
	context, we describe the {\sc contract} framework and architecture
	for exactly this purpose, and describe a concrete instantiation of
	this architecture as a prototype system applied to an aerospace aftercare
	scenario.},
