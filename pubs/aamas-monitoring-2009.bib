abstract = {The behaviours of autonomous agents may deviate from those deem- ed
	to be for the good of the societal systems of which they are a part.
	Norms have therefore been proposed as a means to regulate agent behaviours
	in open and dynamic systems, where these norms specify the obliged,
	permitted and prohibited behaviours of agents. Regulation can effectively
	be achieved through use of enforcement mechanisms that result in
	a net loss of utility for an agent in cases where the agent's behaviour
	fails to comply with the norms. Recognition of compliance is thus
	crucial for achieving regulation. In this paper we propose a generic
	architecture for observation of agent behaviours, and recognition
	of these behaviours as constituting, or counting as, compliance or
	violation. The architecture deploys monitors that receive inputs
	from observers, and processes these inputs together with transition
	network representations of individual norms. In this way, monitors
	determine the fulfillment or violation status of norms. The paper
	also describes a proof of concept implementation and deployment of
	monitors in electronic contracting environments.},
