abstract = {In this paper we consider the implications of imperfect monitoring in a stochastic environment for both the agents and the normative organisation in a normative MAS. We introduce a notion of information asymmetry to characterise the agentsâ€™ knowledge of the monitoring strategy, and show that there are potential benefits of information asymmetry for the normative organisation in reducing its cost of enforcement.},
