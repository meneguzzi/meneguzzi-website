	abstract={Human users trying to plan and accomplish information-dependent goals in
highly dynamic environments with prevalent uncertainty must consult various
types of information sources in their decision-making processes while the
information requirements change as they plan and re-plan. When the users
must make time-critical decisions in information-intensive tasks they
become cognitively overloaded not only by the planning activities but also
by the information-gathering activities at various points in the planning
process. We have developed the ANTicipatory Information and Planning Agent
(ANTIPA) to manage information adaptively in order to mitigate user
cognitive overload. To this end, the agent brings information to the user
as a result of user requests but most crucially, it proactively predicts
the user's prospective information needs by recognizing the user's plan;
pre-fetches information that is likely to be used in the future; and offers
the information when it is relevant to the current or future planning
decisions. This paper describes a fully implemented agent of the ANTIPA
architecture using a decision-theoretic user model, and reports preliminary
user study results.}
