	the good of the societal systems of which they are a part. Norms
	have therefore been proposed as a means to regulate agent behaviours
	in open and dy- namic systems, and may be encoded in electronic contracts
	in order to specify the obliged, permitted and prohibited behaviours
	of agents that are signatories to such contracts. Enactment and management
	of electronic contracts thus enables the use of regulatory mechanisms
	to ensure that agent behaviours comply with the encoded norms. To
	facilitate such mechanisms requires monitoring in order to detect
	and explain violation of norms. In this paper we propose a framework
	for monitoring that is to be implemented and integrated into a suite
	of contract en- actment and management tools. The framework adopts
	a non-intrusive approach to monitoring, whereby the states of a contract
	with respect to its contained norms can be inferred on the basis
	of messages exchanged. Specifically, the framework deploys agents
	that observe messages sent between contract signatories, where these
	messages correspond to agent behaviours and therefore indicate whether
	norms are, or are in danger of, being violated.},
