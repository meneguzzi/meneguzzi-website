  abstract = {This paper describes the Intelligence Control Engine (ICE), a lightweight
	AI engine aimed at the implementation of autonomous agents for computer
	games. The engine thus described comprises a simple agent language
	that can be compiled into an object-oriented programming language,
	as well as a set of libraries to bind the agent into a game. Usage
	of such engine is described as well as examples of operation.},
