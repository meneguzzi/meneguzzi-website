  abstract = {In order to facilitate the development of agent-based software, several
	agent programming languages and architectures, have been created.
	Plans in these architectures are often self-contained procedures
	with an associated \emph{triggering event} and \emph{a context condition},
	while any further information about the consequences of executing
	a plan is absent. However, agents designed using such an approach
	have limited flexibility at runtime, and rely on the designer's ability
	to foresee all relevant situations an agent might have to handle.
	In order to overcome this limitation, we have created AgentSpeak(PL),
	an interpreter capable of performing state-space planning to generate
	new high-level plans. As the planning module creates new plans, the
	plan library is expanded, improving performance over time. However,
	for new plans to be useful in the long run, it is critical that the
	\emph{context condition} associated with new plans is carefully generated.
	In this paper we describe a plan reuse technique aimed at improving
	an agent's runtime performance by deriving optimal context conditions
	for new plans, allowing an agent to reuse generated plans as much
	as possible.},
