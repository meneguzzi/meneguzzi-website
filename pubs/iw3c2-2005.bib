  abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of the XSL-FO standard which allows
	the specification of an unlimited number of arbitrarily shaped page
	regions. These extensions are built on top of XSL-FO 1.1 to enable
	flow content to be laid out into arbitrary shapes and allowing for
	page layouts currently available only to desktop publishing software.
	Such a proposal is expected to leverage XSL-FO towards usage as an
	enabling technology in the generation of content intended for personalized
	printing.},
