abstract = {Dyslexia is a developmental reading disorder characterized by a persistent difficulty to learn how to read fluently, despite normal cognitive abilities. This study aims at investigating the neural underpinnings of this reading disorder in children and teenagers by applying existing machine learning techniques that identify cognitive states based solely on oneâ€™s brain activation. The technique is used to identify whether participants were performing a reading task (identifying whether a word exists or not) or simply resting. The results show above 90% accuracy for classifying whether a participant was performing a reading task. The technique and results are discussed in turn.},
