  abstract = {Argumentation systems are intimately related to nonmonotonic reasoning, of which defeasible reasoning is one widely-known approach. For example, the literature points out defeasible logic (a particular formalisation of defeasible reasoning) as a practical platform upon which to develop an argumentation system. In this paper, we develop an approach to endow AgentSpeak agents with argumentative capabilities using defeasible reasoning, aiming in future work the development of multi-agent applications where agents interact through argumentation-based dialogues. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through an implementation in the Jason platform.},
