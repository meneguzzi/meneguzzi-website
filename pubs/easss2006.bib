  abstract = {Practical agent architectures have often forfeited true autonomy in
	favour of runtime efficiency by using simple triggering conditions
	for the activation of plans from a pre-compiled plan-library. This
	type of inflexible triggering rules is also used for the initiation
	of social behaviour, leaving little space for an agent to truly reason
	about the adoption of one type of behaviour over another. We propose
	the integration of declarative goals and motivations into an architecture
	as a means to create practical autonomous agents.},
