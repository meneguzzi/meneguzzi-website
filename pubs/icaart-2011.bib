  abstract = {In this paper, we present a software assistant agent that can \emph{proactively} manage information on behalf of cognitively overloaded users. We develop an agent architecture, known here as ANTicipatory Information and Planning Agent (\emph{ANTIPA}), to provide the user with relevant information in a timely manner. In order both to recognize user plans unobtrusively and to reason about time constraints, \emph{ANTIPA} integrates probabilistic plan recognition with constraint-based information gathering. This paper focuses on our probabilistic plan prediction algorithm inspired by a decision theory that human users make decisions based on long-term outcomes. A proof of concept user study shows a promising result.},
