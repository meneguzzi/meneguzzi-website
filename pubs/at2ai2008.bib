  abstract = {The development of practical agent languages has progressed significantly
	over recent years, but this has largely been independent of distinct
	developments in aspects of multiagent cooperation and planning. For
	example, while the popular AgentSpeak(L) has had various extensions
	and improvements proposed, it still essentially a single-agent language.
	In response, in this paper, we describe a simple, yet effective,
	technique for multiagent planning that enables an agent to take advantage
	of cooperating agents in a society. In particular, we build on a
	technique that enables new plans to be added to a plan library through
	the invocation of an external planning component, and extend it to
	include the construction of plans involving the chaining of subplans
	of others. Our mechanism makes use of \emph{plan patterns} that insulate
	the planning process from the resulting distributed aspects of plan
	execution through local \emph{proxy plans} that encode information
	about the preconditions and effects of the \emph{external plans}
	provided by agents willing to cooperate. In this way, we allow an
	agent to discover new ways of achieving its goals through local planning
	and the delegation of tasks for execution by others, allowing it
	to overcome individual limitations.},
