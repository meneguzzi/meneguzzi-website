  abstract = {Despite the renewed interest in the declarative nature of goals in
	autonomous agents, a gap between declarative agent theory and practical
	architectures still exists. This can be attributed to the way in
	which architectures of autonomous agents were initially designed
	to rely on a pre-defined plan library that includes all possible
	agent behaviours encoded in procedural plans. In such architectures,
	the agent knows only that when a certain condition holds it should
	execute a plan in its entirety to achieve an implicit goal, and if
	some step of this plan fails, that implicit goal is viewed as impossible.
	An agent operating under this model has limited flexibility and no
	actual autonomy since its only concern is to carry out plans regardless
	of their implications to higher-level objectives. In this report
	we argue that agent autonomy is closely linked to the declarative
	nature of goals and the agent ability to reason about the importance
	of goal achievement as well as the implications of plan and goal
	failure. We review work on motivations and argue that a motivations
	model can be used to direct autonomous agent behaviour and drive
	the agent to adopt or to drop goals. We also review work on multiagent
	interactions aiming to investigate how social behaviour may be initiated
	by an agent following declarative goals. The literature thus reviewed
	allows us to point out a series of issues relating to the construction
	of practical architectures of declarative agents.},
