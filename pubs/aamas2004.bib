  abstract = {Most BDI agent architectures rely on plan libraries in or- der to
	ensure bounded time for means-ends reasoning. Nevertheless, the usage
	of fast planning algorithms to provide the agent with runtime planning
	capabilities is an alternate approach to augment agent autonomy and
	flexibility. This paper proposes an autonomous agent architecture
	based on the integration of a logic-based BDI model with propositional
	planning algorithms through a mapping process.},
