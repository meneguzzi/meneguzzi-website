  abstract = {Norms have been used in multiagent systems as a standard description of agents’ behaviors. A lot of effort has been put in formalizing norms and utilizing them in agents’ decision making. Most of this work focuses on two types of norms: prohibitions and obligations. Agents may have incomplete knowledge about norms in a system for several reasons, such as, deficient norms identification techniques or because norms are not fixed and they may change and emerge, etc. In this work we argue that, by assuming that agents do not have complete knowledge of the norms within a system permission norms are fundamental for modeling unknown normative states. Using Event Calculus, we propose a formal representation of permission norm and we show how to use it in agent normative practical reasoning. A simple mineral mining scenario has been used to demonstrate our work, which was implemented in a popular agent programming language.},
