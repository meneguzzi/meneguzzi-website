  abstract = {One of the most widely studied agent models is based on the notions
	of beliefs, desires and intentions (or BDI) as mental attitudes that
	guide the selection of courses of actions. However, BDI agent languages
	have been used mostly in the context of single agents based on a
	plan library of behaviours invoked reactively and, though they provide
	a theoretically sound basis for agent development, they offer limited
	support for multiagent systems with dynamic plan libraries.
	
	
	In particular, when new plans not foreseeable at initial design time
	are required, the agent must be redesigned. Moreover, when designing
	multiagent systems, agent languages provide at most a communication
	language with no other consideration of interaction.
	
	
	This thesis aims to address these limitations by introducing a new
	agent language and architecture that includes a mechanism for processing
	goals in a manner that decouples goal achievement from plan execution,
	as well as generating new plans to cope with unforeseen situations
	at design time. It bridges the gap between agent languages and multiagent
	systems by introducing a simple cooperation mechanism together with
	a norm processing mechanism aimed to providing some degree of societal
	control.},
