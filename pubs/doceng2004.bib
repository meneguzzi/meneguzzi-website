  abstract = {Recent advances in digital press technology have enabled the creation
	of high-quality personalized documents, with the potential of generating
	an entire batch of one-of-a-kind documents. Even though digital presses
	are capable of printing such document sets as fast as they would
	print regular press jobs, raster image processing might possibly
	be performed for every different page in the job. Such process demands
	a large computational effort and it is therefore interesting to gather
	repeated images that are used throughout all documents and rasterize
	them as few times as possible. Moreover, performing such process
	separately from document production in the publishing workflow allows
	optimization to be performed prior to final printing, thus allowing
	it to take press hardware specifics into account, and reducing the
	time taken for it to produce the final output. This paper describes
	techniques to perform this task using PPML as the document description
	language, as well as the main issues concerning this kind of document
	optimization. Several gathering policies are described along with
	explana- tory examples. We also provide and discuss experimental
	data supporting the use of such strategies.},
