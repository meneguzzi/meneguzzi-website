  abstract = {The logistics of the aerospace aftermarket raises a number of very
	interesting challenges from the perspective of electronic contracting.
	This is a highly dynamic domain, where contracts are established
	between airlines and engine manufacturers, as well as between engine
	manufacturers all the way down the supply lines, providing a particularly
	illustrative showcase for the technologies developed in the contract
	project. In this paper, we describe such a domain, as well as our
	modelling of it as a multiagent simulator where the contract framework
	has been used to monitor for compliance with norms.},
