abstract={In order to address the challenges of greener energy generation, new techniques need to be developed both to generate electricity with lower emissions and to optimize energy distribution and consumption. Smart grid techniques have been developed specifically to tackle this latter challenge. This paper aims to contribute in improving the efficiency of energy use within a single household by modeling appliances within it as a multiagent system (MAS). We model this system as a virtual organization that seeks to minimize energy consumption while reaching a tradeoff between user comfort, energy cost and limiting peak energy usage.}
