  abstract = {BDI agent languages provide a useful abstraction for complex systems
	comprised of interactive autonomous entities, but they have been
	used mostly in the context of single agents with a static plan library
	of behaviours invoked reactively. These languages provide a theoretically
	sound basis for agent design but are very limited in providing direct
	support for autonomy and societal cooperation needed for large scale
	systems. Some techniques for autonomy and cooperation have been explored
	in the past in ad hoc implementations, but not incorporated
	in any agent language. In order to address these shortcomings we
	extend the well known AgentSpeak(L) BDI agent language to include
	behaviour generation through planning, declarative goals and motivated
	goal adoption. We also develop a language-specific multiagent cooperation
	scheme and, to address potential problems arising from autonomy in
	a multiagent system, we extend our agents with a mechanism for norm
	processing leveraging existing theoretical work. These extensions
	allow for greater autonomy in the resulting systems, enabling them
	to synthesise new behaviours at runtime and to cooperate in non-scripted
	patterns.},
