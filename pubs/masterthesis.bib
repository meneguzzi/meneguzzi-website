  abstract = {The majority of BDI agent implementations perform means-end reasoning
	using statically defined plan libraries, thus limiting their flexibility
	at runtime. One of the reasons for this limiting choice in the implementation
	is the fact that deciding whether an agent is able to accomplish
	its goal or not is proven to be a very complex problem. On the other
	hand, advances in the field of propositional planning have enabled
	a larger class of problems to be tractable. Therefore, this dissertation
	aims to describe the relationship between BDI agents and propositional
	planning. In order to accomplish such goal, we describe a mapping
	between the mental states used in the BDI model and propositional
	planning formalisms. The mapping thus defined is implemented in an
	extension to the X-BDI agent model that includes Graphplan as its
	propositional planning algorithm. Finally, the implemented prototype
	is used to model and execute a number of case studies.},
