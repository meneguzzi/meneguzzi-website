abstract={In the presence of vast amount of data and their semantic representation, it is a formidable task for a human decision-maker to effectively locate the most relevant facts, identify critical conflicts, and master a big picture of the information for high quality decision making. This paper proposes a presentation framework which applies argumentation-based reasoning to present relevant facts and answers. Knowledge retrieved from a distributed semantic KB are fed into an argumentation- based reasoning engine which reorganizes the knowledge into coherent arguments, estimates the beliefs of the arguments, and analyzes the pattern of conflicts among the arguments to preliminarily determine the acceptability of these arguments for the decision-maker to review. In order to lower the decision-makerâ€™s cognitive load, the argumentation is pruned to present only the arguments and the conflicts that most likely concern the decision-maker. This argumentation pruning algorithm can be adapted to enable a decision-maker to interact with the system and navigate through the information incrementally unfolding the argumentation constructed for the answers.}
