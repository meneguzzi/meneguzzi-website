  abstract = {This paper describes the use of fault tolerance in a multi- agent
	system. Such an approach is based on the modeling of autonomous agents
	with planning capabilities. These capabilities are used by the agent
	to recover from faults occurring in its surrounding environment,
	e.g. hardware faults, or in its internal representation thereof,
	e.g. software faults. The expected fault-tolerant behavior is tested
	using fault injection either in the system described by the agent
	or in the environment in which the agent (system) is embedded into.},
