abstract = {In this paper, we give formal semantics to speech acts for argumentative dialogues in the context of an agent-oriented programming language. Our approach to giving formal semantics to such speech acts uses operational semantics and builds upon existing work that provides computationally grounded semantics for agent mental attitudes such as beliefs and goals.},
